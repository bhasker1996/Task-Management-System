1. To run the Application, please install MySQL workbench and create a database named "Taskdatabase" and then start running.
2. The URL to check the API's with swagger is "localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html".
3. Since i have used the JWT Authentication so for every API you need to provide the token
    1) So for that you have to signUp first if you haven't
    2) If you have signedUp/register then login with username and password using authcontroller in swagger documentation then you will get the token.
    3) Copy that token and then check the APIs.
4. I generally didn't made any assumptions so far.
5. Mainly please download the Intellij to run the Application.
